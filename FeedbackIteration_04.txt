Iteration 4

-------------------
##### Changes #####
- added multiple minigames per ball
- added visual indication of how many minigames a ball has
- colored the indicators based on if the minigame is Idle, Active, Completed or Failed
- added multiplier
- added colored background to the balls
- added scorching on the outside of each ball in an arc for the part that is below the deadLineHeight
- added WallDodge minigame

To-Do:
- fix speed interpolation messing with time of arrival at deadlineheight
THIS is because the speed should already be at targetspeed
- add probability that balls contain an extra life, only added when the ball is perfectly completed

##### Feedback #####
Playtester 1: Wouter
- set rotation game is not clear/intu√Øtive at all that you have to control the line with left/right
- make all rotating lines thicker and more visible
- make green always good and red always bad
- hard to understand minigames when first seeing them
- start with 1 minigame and 1 per ball and introduce new minigames as you go while also increasing the number of minigames per ball
- extra feedback when you are doing good/bad, extra sounds, flashing colors, "good job" appearing
