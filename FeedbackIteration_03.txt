Iteration 3

-------------------
##### Changes #####
- added utils::DrawArcBand and utils::FillArcBand functions
- added new color functionality to the engine that enables you to set a global color and alpha to overwrite other colors. Handy to force an entire object to draw in a single color
- added a deadline, you need to solve each ball before it passes below this line.
- moved all spiral/arc drawing functions from utils to separate Spiral class
- balls are now only active when they are fully visible on the screen
- balls are bigger so they are more easily visible
- added TimeToComplete() to all minigames
- added struct Config{} to all minigames, this config changes depending on the difficulty
- added ConfigureDifficulty() to all minigames
- added smooth interpolation for the ball speed

----------------------------
##### Target Questions #####
- Does the new idea with the minigames inside of the balls work? Is it fun?
- Is the difficulty scaling fun?

- Concept is way more fun than iteration 2
- small bug with the SpiralGatesGame with clicking on already opened gates
- horizontal deadLine is a bit distracting, maybe make it light grey
- make the difficulty scale less quickly
- add lots more minigames to increase fun/complexity/variation
- make it so you only have I try per minigame, otherwise it is a bit confusing for example with the SpiralGatesGame restarting when you misclick
- SelectColorGame and SetRotationGame could already be activated when not fully in view, it is good however that the SpiralGatesGame only starts when fully in view
