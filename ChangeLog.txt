Gameplay scripting Change log:
############## Iteration 1 ##############
- added basic system with balls continuously falling down
- added the lighter with double rings
- marked the next ball as red visually
- pressing space at the right time now captures balls and increase the score
- added different sized balls and with the up/down arrows you can now match the size of the lighter to catch them
- Added a health bar, pressing space at the wrong time and not capturing a ball now reduces lives
- New balls are spawned at the top of the window and wait there until they are activated and fall down
