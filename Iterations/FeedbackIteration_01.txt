Iteration 1
-------------------
##### Game Idea #####
2 Words: Wind, Candle
There is a fire that needs to be kept going. The bigger the fire the more points and when the fire dies the game ends. There is also a lighter just above the fire. Powerups/balls/fuel "things" fall down and you need to catch them with the lighter and activate them to help grow the fire. Some balls might add some wind or another one throws fuel on the fire or a bad one throws water over it, etc...

-------------------
##### Changes #####
- added basic system with balls continuously falling down
- added the lighter with double rings
- marked the next ball as red visually
- pressing space at the right time now captures balls and increase the score
- added different sized balls and with the up/down arrows you can now match the size of the lighter to catch them
- Added a health bar, pressing space at the wrong time and not capturing a ball now reduces lives
- New balls are spawned at the top of the window and wait there until they are activated and fall down

----------------------------
##### Target Questions #####
- Is the basic idea of the game fun?
- Is the game comprehensible for players?
- Does the vertical more mobile screen resolution work?
- Is the idea not to difficult or out of scope for the retake exam?

--------------------
##### Feedback #####
Playtester 1: Wouter
- basic gameplay loop is fun although a bit too fast probably
- Move score and health down below the lighter so it is better visible during gameplay
- more visual cues for when the ball was succesfully caught or not
- some rotating elements that need to be matched
- remove succesfully caught balls and balls that are not caught just keep moving down until they are off-screen
- idea with the lighter and fire is not necessary for the game. The balls just falling down and you needing to catch them is enough.
- change the randomness of the size so it is not possible to have 5 times the same ball size after eachother

Playtester 2: Bart
- Give different colors to different sized balls so it is visually clear which lighter size to pick to catch them
- the idea of needing to unlock balls like a lock before you get it's points
- fire idea only seems to be a visual indication of the score and might add visual clutter on the screen. Basic idea with the balls is fun enough.
- Some balls give lifes other balls take away lifes like bombs
- Add some sound

Playtester 3: ALex
- Add left/right movement with fixed steps
- Make balls disappear if you catch them
- Add some rotation to some of the balls
- Ball that changes size when falling down so the player needs to continuously adjust to match the size
- Per ball missed reduce points or when giving a wrong input so you cant spam spacebar to catch a ball
- Get to 100 points in a certain time
- Multiple shapes like triangles and squares
- Speeding up the more points you get
- The more points you get the smaller the margin to catch each ball gets.
- Balls come from every direction and the player has free movement over the entire screen to catch as many balls as quickly as possible.  (changing screen dimension more to HD instead of mobile res)
- Multi-stage balls
- balls when caught changing size
- Balls when caught explode into multiple balls
- Balls with a shield that needs to be destroyed before being able to catch it
- Add background
- Add some sound

##### Analysis #####
- Is the basic idea of the game fun?
	All 3 playtesters seemed to like the basic idea and think it has a lot of potential. 
- Is the game comprehensible for players?
	A lot of feedback came down to adding some more visual cues as to what is happening. For example when you succesfully caught a ball.
- Does the vertical more mobile screen resolution work?
	An idea was given for an HD resolution version of the game but I thik I will stay with the mobile feel as this seemed to resonate most with the playtesters.
- Is the idea not to difficult or out of scope for the retake exam?
	Got some feedback on the entire fire and wind/fuel idea that it is a bit too much and not really needed. That the game is fun enough without it. I also already thought a bit in this direction as visually adding fire and making it grow larger with the score would be too difficult and out of scope.

Other:
- adding some more variation in gameplay. Luckily I received a lot of ideas for that as well as still having a lot of own ideas.
- I got some feedback to add a background and some sound but still is also out of scope I belive. Adding the extra visual cues should help the most with clarifying the game.
